Parent to Child communication is like sharing information from a big part to a small part. Imagine you have a big box (the parent) and a small box (the child) inside it.

To share something from the big box to the small box, you need to make a special connection. In the small box (the child), you put a sticker called "@api" on something you want to share. This sticker tells everyone that it's okay to share this thing.

For example, let's say you have a small box (the child) with a sticker on a toy called "simpletext". It means you can share this toy.

Now, in the big box (the parent), you have a string. To share this string with the small box (the child), you put the small box's name on it and give it to the small box.

So, in simple terms, Parent to Child communication is like sharing a toy from a big box to a small box using special stickers.
